here's an example of how you could structure a Spring Boot project with multiple API versions, including the controllers, DTOs, and service classes


src/
  main/
    java/
      com.example/
        controllers/
          v1/
            UserControllerV1.java
          v2/
            UserControllerV2.java
        dtos/
          v1/
            UserDtoV1.java
          v2/
            UserDtoV2.java
        services/
          v1/
            UserServiceV1.java
          v2/
            UserServiceV2.java
        Application.java



In this example, we have two versions of the API: version 1 and version 2. Each version has its own set of controllers, DTOs, and services.

The UserControllerV1 and UserControllerV2 classes are the controllers for each version of the API. They handle the incoming requests and call the appropriate service methods.

The UserDtoV1 and UserDtoV2 classes are the DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for each version of the API. They represent the data being exchanged between the client and the server.

The UserServiceV1 and UserServiceV2 classes are the services for each version of the API. They contain the business logic for each version of the API.

Finally, the Application.java class is the main entry point for the application, and it sets up the Spring Boot configuration.

To use these classes in your application, you would define the appropriate version of the controller, DTO, or service as a dependency in your other classes, using the appropriate version qualifier, such as @Qualifier("v1") or @Qualifier("v2").

For example, in the UserControllerV1 class, you might inject the UserServiceV1 like this:


@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/users")
public class UserControllerV1 {

    private final UserServiceV1 userService;

    public UserControllerV1(@Qualifier("v1") UserServiceV1 userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

    // API endpoints for version 1 of the API...
}

And in the UserServiceV1 class, you might inject the UserRepository like this:



@Service
@Qualifier("v1")
public class UserServiceV1 {

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserServiceV1(@Qualifier("v1") UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    // Business logic for version 1 of the API...
}


By following this structure, you can keep your API versions separate and maintainable, while still allowing for future versions to be added as needed.
